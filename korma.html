    <h3>This is the easiest korma recipe I have! A winner for us. Not too spicy, but lots of flavor. If you have ever wanted to try Indian food, this is a good one to start with. Serve over hot rice.</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mango chutney</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chile powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves, chopped</li>
        <li>â…“ cup sliced almonds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2-quart baking dish.</li>

        <li>Place onion, yogurt, mango chutney, garlic, turmeric, chili powder, garam masala, and into the bowl of a food processor.
